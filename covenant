## The Daykeeper’s Covenant  
**Protocols of Practice, Liability, and Ethics**

To accept the title of **Daykeeper** is to accept responsibility for how others spend their Time, Attention, and Energy. By opening and using this Manual, you agree to the following Covenant.

***

### I. Liability & Scope of Practice  
**“We are Strategists, not Surgeons.”**

The Chrono‑Sync System draws on principles from chronobiology, behavioral psychology, and spiritual archetypes. It is a **strategic guidance system**, not a medical or financial service.

1. **Medical Scope**  
   - You are **not** a medical or mental health professional (unless separately licensed as such).  
   - If a client presents with clinical depression, mania, suicidal ideation, self‑harm, addiction, or physical trauma, you must **immediately refer** them to an appropriate licensed professional or emergency service.  
   - The *Emergency Brake* and related tools are **stabilizing supports**, not diagnoses, treatment, or cures.

2. **Financial Scope**  
   - You are **not** a financial advisor.  
   - The *Merchant Hour* and any prosperity‑related practices are for **productivity, focus, and energetic alignment only**, not investment, tax, or legal advice.  
   - You may assist clients with clarity and timing; you may not guarantee outcomes, income, or returns.

3. **Free Will Clause**  
   - You provide **maps, mirrors, and timing windows**.  
   - The client remains fully responsible for their own choices, actions, and outcomes, both inside and outside sessions.  
   - You may not claim control over a client’s fate, destiny, or external events.

***

### II. Embodiment & Competence  
**“You cannot pour from an empty well.”**

A Daykeeper must *embody* the work before offering it.

Before accepting payment for any Daykeeper services, you agree to:

1. **The 30‑Day Solstice Requirement**  
   - Track your own biological rhythm and daily pattern for **30 consecutive days** using the Master Codex (or equivalent tracking protocol in this system).  
   - Complete all required exercises as written.

2. **Energetic Proficiency**  
   - Successfully perform the *Furnace Protocol* (Level II Radiance) until you can consistently perceive and regulate your own internal heat/energy response.  
   - You are responsible for knowing your limits and grounding yourself before and after sessions.

3. **Archetype Mastery**  
   - Memorize and be able to accurately recall the **24 Archetypes** and their core qualities without relying on visible reference during a session.  
   - You may keep discreet notes, but you may not “wing it” or improvise meanings that conflict with the system.

If you have not met these standards, your role is **Student**, not **Daykeeper**, and you must not represent yourself otherwise.

***

### III. Ethics & Power Dynamics  
**“We interrupt patterns to liberate, not to control.”**

This system includes advanced psychological tools (e.g., **Covert Discovery Questions**, **Vibe Control**, **Hypnotic Pacing**). These carry real influence.

1. **Prohibited Uses**  
   - You may not use any technique from this system to:  
     - induce fear or panic to sell additional services,  
     - create emotional dependency,  
     - shame, humiliate, or undermine a client’s self‑trust,  
     - coerce decisions around money, relationships, or beliefs.  

2. **Mandated Intent**  
   - Your use of these tools must be directed toward:  
     - helping clients access their *own* inner clarity,  
     - interrupting unhelpful patterns so they can choose freely,  
     - supporting grounded, informed decision‑making.

3. **Client Autonomy**  
   - You honor a client’s right to say *no*, to pause, or to end a session at any time.  
   - You do not position yourself as an infallible authority. You are a **Specialist in Timing and Framing**, not a master of their life.

***

### IV. Sovereignty & Time  
**“Time is Energetic, not Fatalistic.”**

The Chrono‑Sync map is a **weather report**, not a script.

1. **Non‑Fatalism Statement**  
   - You must clearly communicate to every client that charts, cycles, and archetypes describe **tendencies and conditions**, not fixed destinies.  
   - Terms like “Conflict,” “Threshold,” or “Storm” indicate an **energetic climate**—a call for preparation, not fear.

2. **Framing of Outcomes**  
   - You do not tell clients “what will happen” as if it were unavoidable.  
   - You offer **windows of opportunity** and **conditions for best results**:  
     > “This is a powerful time to initiate X,”  
     > “This window favors reflection over pushing,” etc.

3. **The Daykeeper’s Motto**  
   - “I do not tell you what must happen. I help you choose **when and how** to make it happen.”

***

### V. Brand Integrity & Representation (optional but recommended)

1. **Title Usage**  
   - You may use the title **Daykeeper** only while you remain in compliance with this Covenant and any additional guidelines in the Handbook or License Agreement.  

2. **Claims & Marketing**  
   - You will not advertise guaranteed results, miracles, or absolute predictions.  
   - Testimonials must be truthful and not exaggerated beyond what the client actually reported.

3. **Revocation**  
   - The creator(s) of this system reserve the right to revoke or decline Daykeeper status if your conduct is found to violate these ethical, legal, or energetic standards.
